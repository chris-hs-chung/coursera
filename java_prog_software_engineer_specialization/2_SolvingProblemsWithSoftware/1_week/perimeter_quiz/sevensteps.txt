- Start with totalPerim = 0
- Start with prevPt = last point

Find distance between prevPt and currPt. It is currentDistance.
Update totalPerim = totalPerim + currentDistance
Update prevPt to be the currPt.

Find distance between prevPt and currPt. It is currentDistance.
Update totalPerim = totalPerim + currentDistance
Update prevPt to be the currPt.

Find distance between prevPT and currPt. It is currentDistance.
Update totalPerim = totalPerim + currentDistance
Update prevPt to be the currPt.

Find distance between prevPt and 4th point. It is currentDistance.
Update totalPerim = totalPerim + currentDistance
Update prevPT to be the currPt.

- Answer is totalPerim.

**********************************************************


- totalPerim = 0

- prevPt = last point

- For each currPt in the shape,
	- Find distance between prevPT and currPt; name it currDist
	- Update totalPerim = totalPerim + currDist
	- Update prevPt to be the currPt

- totalPerim is answer
