1. Find first occurence of "ATG" at startIndex.

2. Starting from startIndex + 3, find index of "TAA" and call it currIndex.

3. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.

4. If not, them start from (currIndex + 1), to find the next "TAA", and update it to currIndex. 

5. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.

6. It was, so everything in between is the gene.

1. Find first occurence of "ATG" at startIndex.

2. Starting from startIndex + 3, find index of "TAA" and call it currIndex.

3. As long as currIndex is not -1
	4. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.
		5. If so, then startIndex to currIndex + 3 is answer.
		5. If not, then start at currIndex + 1, and update currIndex for the next "TAA".
