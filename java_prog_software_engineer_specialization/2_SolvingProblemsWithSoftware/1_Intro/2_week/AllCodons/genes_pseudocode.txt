1. Find first occurence of "ATG" at startIndex.

2. Starting from startIndex + 3, find index of "TAA" and call it currIndex.

3. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.

4. If not, them start from (currIndex + 1), to find the next "TAA", and update it to currIndex. 

5. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.

6. It was, so everything in between is the gene.

********************************************************************

1. Find first occurence of "ATG" at startIndex.

If startIndex is -1, then return empty string.

2. Starting from startIndex + 3, find index of "TAA" and call it currIndex.

3. As long as currIndex is not -1
	4. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.
		5. If so, then startIndex to currIndex + 3 is answer.
		5. If not, then start at currIndex + 1, and update currIndex for the next "TAA".

Abstraction of finding the stop codon

1. Find first occurence of "ATG" at startIndex.

2. If startIndex is -1, then return empty string.

3. findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TAA") =  taaIndex
    1. Starting from startIndex + 3, find index of "TAA" and call it currIndex.
    2. As long as currIndex is not -1
        3. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.
            4. If so, then startIndex to currIndex + 3 is answer.
            4. If not, then start at currIndex + 1, and update currIndex for the next "TAA".

findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TAG") = tagIndex

findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TGA") = tgaIndex

Take the smallest of taaIndex, tagIndex, tgaIndex = minIndex

The answer is the text from startIndex to minIndex + 3

Abstraction of finding the stop codon

1. Find first occurence of "ATG" at startIndex.

2. If startIndex is -1, then return empty string.

method - findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, stopCodon)
    1. Find stopCodon starting from (startIndex + 3), call the result currIndex
    2. As long as currIndex is not -1
        3. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.
            4. If so, then startIndex to currIndex + 3 is answer.
            4. If not, then start at currIndex + 1, and update currIndex for the next stopCodon.

3. findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TAA") = taaIndex

4. findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TAG") = tagIndex

5. findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TGA") = tgaIndex

Take the smallest of taaIndex, tagIndex, tgaIndex = minIndex

If minIndex is dnaStr.length(), then the answer is empty string.

The answer is the text from startIndex to minIndex + 3

What if there are no valid stop codons?

1. Find first occurence of "ATG" at startIndex.

2. If startIndex is -1, then return empty string.

method - findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, stopCodon)
    1. Find stopCodon starting from (startIndex + 3), call the result currIndex
    2. As long as currIndex is not -1
        3. Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3.
            4. If so, then startIndex to currIndex + 3 is answer.
            4. If not, then start at currIndex + 1, and update currIndex for the next stopCodon.

3. findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TAA") = taaIndex

4. findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TAG") = tagIndex

5. findStopCodon(dnaStr, startIndex, "TGA") = tgaIndex

6. Check if taaIndex == -1  OR  ( tgaIndex is not -1 AND tgaIndex < taaIndex)
    7.  If so, set minIndex to tgaIndex.
    8.  If not, set minIndex to taaIndex.

9. Check if minIndex == -1  OR  (tagIndex is not -1 AND tagIndex < minIndex)
    10. If so, set minIndex to tagIndex

11. If  minIndex is -1, then answer is "" 
12. else, answer is the text from startIndex to minIndex + 3
