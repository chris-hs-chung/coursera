Find first occurence of start codon = startIndex
currIndex = first occurence of stop codon
while stop codon exists
    check if gene is multiple of three --> (currIndex - startIndex) % 3 == 0
        if so, return index
        if not, update currIndex to start at currIndex + 3;

if no stop codon, then return length of dna
