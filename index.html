    <h1>My Coursera Journey</h1>

    <p>This is a site so that I can keep track of my progress of learning and completing the courses and specializations on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">coursera</a></p>
    
    <p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: Since I am posting my progress, some of the files have solutions to assignments. So if you are planning on taking these courses, try not to look.</p>

    <p>In the past, I completed the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support" target="_blank">Google IT Support Professional Certificate</a></p>

    <p>I took other courses like Harvard's CS50 and many cycles of tutorial hells on freecodecamp and codecademy, but I think it's time for me to take it to the next level and learn oop. So I decided to take a specialization on Coursera called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming">Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization</a>. Currently, it's kicking my ass, but I love the challenge because I'm learning a lot. What's nice is that the specialization is a collab taught by Duke University and UCSan Diego.</p>
